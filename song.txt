I am looking out of someone's window and see someone's sky
I can't see a star that's mine
I roamed the roads back and forth
Having looked back couldn't find footprints on my path.
 
But if there's a pack of cigarettes in my pocket
Then the day's not all that bad
And a boarding pass to a silver-wing-plane,
That takes off leaving just a shadow behind
 
Noone wanted to be found guilty without wine,
Noone wanted to pick the coals with bare hands
And death without music is not picturesque,
So I wouldn't want to die without it
 
But if there's a pack of cigarettes in my pocket
Then the day's not all that bad
And a boarding pass to a silver-wing-plane,
That takes off leaving just a shadow behind
