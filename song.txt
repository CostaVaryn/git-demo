But if you have a pack of cigarettes in your pocket,
So everything is not so bad today.
And a plane ticket with a silver wing,
That, taking off, leaves the earth only a shadow.

Noone wanted to be found guilty without wine,
Noone wanted to pick the coals with bare hands
And death without music is not picturesque,
So I wouldn't want to die without it
